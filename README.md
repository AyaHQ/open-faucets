# open-faucets
**An open-source platform for faucets, built for the community by the community.**

## Features
- Simple and efficient way to access Ethereum testnet tokens.
- Multi-Testnet Support: Supports testnets like Sepolia, Holesky, and other Ethereum-compatible networks, enabling versatile testing environments. 
- User-friendly wallet integration for seamless token requests.
- Anti-spam measures such as verification through GitHub or CAPTCHA.
- Backend support for advanced features like analytics, notifications, and enhanced anti-spam mechanisms.
- Admin functionality to fund the faucet contract directly via the platform.

## Steps to Acquire Testnet Tokens

1. **Choose a Faucet**:
   - Visit the OpenFaucet platform and select the testnet faucet corresponding to your desired Ethereum testnet (e.g., Sepolia).

2. **Connect Your Wallet**:
   - Use a compatible wallet service such as MetaMask, WalletConnect, or Coinbase Wallet to connect to the faucet. Ensure your wallet is configured for the appropriate testnet.

3. **Token Distribution**:
   - A specific amount of tokens is allocated to eligible wallets within a set duration (e.g., daily or weekly).
   - Access to the faucet requires holding a community NFT, which verifies the user's eligibility.

4. **Receive Tokens**:
   - After submitting your request, tokens will be transferred to your specified wallet address. Use your wallet or a blockchain explorer like Etherscan to monitor the transaction.

## Admin Features

- **Funding the Contract**:
   - Admins can directly fund the faucet contract using their wallet via the platform's admin interface.
   - The admin dashboard provides insights into the current balance of the contract and allows for token replenishment to ensure smooth operations.

## Backend Integration

- **Analytics**: Provides insights into token distribution, user activity, and overall platform usage.
- **Enhanced Anti-Spam Features**: Implements CAPTCHA, IP-based rate limiting, and GitHub verification for added security.
- **API Support**: Offers APIs for external integrations and detailed user metrics.

## Dynamic Frontend with Next.js

- **Modern Framework**: Built with Next.js to provide a dynamic, server-rendered frontend.
- **Seamless Wallet Integration**: Real-time wallet connection and testnet switching.
- **Enhanced UX**: Dynamic pages for user-friendly interactions, including eligibility checks and token monitoring.

## How It Works

- **Faucet Selection**: Users pick their desired Ethereum testnet (e.g., Sepolia) from the available options.
- **Wallet Connection**: Users connect their wallet to the platform, ensuring it is configured for the appropriate testnet.
- **Verification Process**: Optional measures like CAPTCHA or GitHub login help minimize spam and abuse.
